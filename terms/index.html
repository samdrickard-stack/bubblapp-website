        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last updated: 10 February 2026</p>

        <p>Welcome to Bubbl. These Terms of Service (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your use of the Bubbl iOS application (&ldquo;the App&rdquo;) operated by Bubbl (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;our&rdquo;, or &ldquo;us&rdquo;). By downloading, installing, or using Bubbl, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.</p>

        <h2>1. The Service</h2>
        <p>Bubbl is a visual task management application for iOS. It allows you to organise tasks as interactive bubbles, collaborate with partners through Co-Pop, and use voice input to create tasks. The App is available as a free service with optional paid features through a Bubbl+ subscription.</p>

        <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
        <p>You may use Bubbl as a guest without creating an account. Guest mode provides local-only functionality.</p>
        <p>To access cloud sync, Co-Pop sharing, and other connected features, you must create an account using Apple Sign-In, Google Sign-In, or email and password. You are responsible for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Maintaining the security of your account credentials</li>

If you do not cancel before the trial ends, your subscription will automatically begin and you will be charged.</p>

        <h2>4. User Content</h2>
        <p>You retain full ownership of all content you create in Bubbl, including bubble titles, notes, checklist items, photos, file attachments, and categories (&ldquo;User Content&rdquo;).</p>
        <p>By using the App, you grant us a limited, non-exclusive licence to store, process, display, and transmit your User Content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the service. This includes:</p>

            <li>Processing your voice recordings for transcription and text extraction via third-party AI services</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not use your content for advertising, training AI models, or any purpose unrelated to delivering the service.</p>
        <p>You are responsible for your User Content and must ensure it does not violate any laws or these Terms.</p>

        <h2>5. Co-Pop (Partner Sharing)</h2>

            <li>You can revoke sharing at any time by unsharing the bubble or unlinking from the partner</li>
            <li>When you unshare or delete a shared bubble, it is removed from your partner&rsquo;s view</li>
            <li>If you unpair from a partner, all shared bubble links between you are removed</li>
            <li>Free users are limited to 1 partner link and 3 actively shared bubbles (pending or accepted) at any time</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You are responsible for the content you share with partners. Do not share content that is harmful, abusive, or otherwise inappropriate.</p>

        <h2>6. Voice Input</h2>
        <p>Bubbl offers voice input for creating bubbles and checklist items. By using this feature, you consent to the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Audio is recorded locally on your device</li>
            <li>Recordings are sent to our secure backend (Firebase Cloud Functions), which processes them using OpenAI&rsquo;s Whisper API for transcription</li>
            <li>The transcribed text may also be processed by OpenAI&rsquo;s language model (GPT) to extract checklist items or generate a concise title from your speech</li>
            <li><strong>Audio recordings are deleted immediately after transcription</strong> &ndash; they are not stored on our servers or by OpenAI</li>
            <li>Only the resulting text (title, notes, or checklist items) is retained as part of your bubble content</li>
            <li>Voice input accuracy may vary and we do not guarantee the accuracy of transcriptions or AI-generated text</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Acceptable Use</h2>
